### A “naive” implementantion of a job based search engine using genetic algorithms

> In the computer science field of artificial intelligence, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic that mimics the process of natural evolution. This heuristic is routinely used to generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems.

Features :
- Background job using threads and/or processes for performance comparison
- Web app for controlling and creating search jobs
- Swappable GAs and search engines used
